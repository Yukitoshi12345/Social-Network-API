<h1 align = "center"> Social Network API </h1>

In the digital age, where social media platforms are the cornerstone of global communication, a startup aims to revolutionise the landscape with an advanced social network. To achieve scalability and flexibility in managing diverse and voluminous data, the startup seeks to implement an API that leverages the power of a NoSQL database. By choosing a NoSQL database, the social media startup positions itself to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently. This approach is essential for supporting the dynamic nature of social interactions, including posts, comments, and user profiles, thereby ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

The envisioned social network API is designed to be robust and user-friendly, enabling the social media platform to initiate its server and synchronise Mongoose models with the MongoDB database effortlessly. Through intuitive command executions, the API facilitates the display of users and thoughts data in well-structured JSON format via GET routes, enhancing developer convenience and data readability. Moreover, the API supports extensive functionality for user interactions, including the ability to create, update, and delete users and thoughts, as well as manage reactions and friendships through POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. This comprehensive suite of features ensures that the social network can offer a rich and interactive user experience, fostering community engagement and growth.
